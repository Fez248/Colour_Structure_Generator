# Colour_Structure_Generator
Project 1

Desktop app that creates colour palettes randomly. This app is part of a series of personal projects which function is to master wxWiddgets.
It still has some things that could be improved. Changing the colour of the text also, displaying the hex values of the palette, better random generator and the code structure itself.
But all of this will come in Project 2 with some new features.
