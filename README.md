# Colour_Structure_Generator

Desktop app that creates colour palets randomly. This project is part of a series of personal projects which function is to master wxWiddgets.
It still has some things that could be improved. Changing the colour of the text also, displaying the hex values of the palet, better random generator and the code structure itself.
But all of this will come in Project 2 with some new features.
